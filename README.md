# Mushroom-competition
In this project, I built a machine learning model to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous. The company provided separate training and testing datasets, allowing for reliable evaluation.

To assess model performance, I used metrics such as accuracy, recall, and a confusion matrix.
A Random Forest classifier served as the main algorithm, and I tested two different modeling approaches to compare results and improve overall performance.
